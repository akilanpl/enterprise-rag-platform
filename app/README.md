# Enterprise RAG Platform

An **enterprise-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform** designed for secure, on-premise and private-cloud deployments.  
This system enables organizations to query internal knowledge bases using large language models while maintaining **data privacy, security, and controlled evaluation**.

---

##  Overview

This project implements an end-to-end **RAG pipeline** that combines:
- Document ingestion and preprocessing
- Vector-based semantic retrieval
- Context-aware LLM response generation
- Modular, extensible architecture suitable for enterprise environments

The platform is designed to be **deployment-agnostic**, supporting local, on-prem, or private infrastructure without reliance on external data sharing.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End RAG Pipeline**
  - Document ingestion (text-based sources)
  - Chunking and embedding generation
  - Vector similarity search
  - Context-grounded LLM inference

- **Enterprise-Focused Design**
  - On-prem / private deployment ready
  - No mandatory external API dependency
  - Configurable model and vector store backends

- **Modular Architecture**
  - Clean separation of ingestion, retrieval, and generation layers
  - Easy to extend with new models, retrievers, or data sources

- **Evaluation-Ready**
  - Designed to support custom evaluation metrics
  - Enables experimentation with retrieval strategies and prompt design
