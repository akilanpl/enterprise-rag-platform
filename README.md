# Enterprise RAG Platform

An enterprise-oriented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for **secure, modular, and on-premise-ready AI deployments**.

This project focuses on building a **production-aligned RAG architecture** with clear separation of ingestion, retrieval, generation, orchestration, and observability layers.

## 🔹 Why this project?

Most RAG demos stop at notebooks.  
This repository focuses on **system design**, **modularity**, and **enterprise constraints** such as:
- Data locality
- Extensibility
- Evaluation readiness
- Observability
